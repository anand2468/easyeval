Educational institutions still rely on slow and inconsistent manual answer sheet evaluation. Due to human fatigue and high workload, teachers often struggle to deliver accurate and timely results, affecting students' learning journey and institutional efficiency. There is no smart, automated, and reliable platform that can evaluate descriptive answers with consistency and transparency.
ZenEval solves this by using AI to automatically read, analyze, and score student answers in seconds, ensuring accurate evaluation, reducing teacher workload, and enabling faster results with insightful analytics.
